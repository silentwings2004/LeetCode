     * Alice and Bob are playing a fantasy battle game consisting of n rounds where they summon one of three magical
     * creatures each round: a Fire Dragon, a Water Serpent, or an Earth Golem. In each round, players simultaneously
     * summon their creature and are awarded points as follows:
     *
     * If one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire
     * Dragon is awarded a point.
     * If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water
     * Serpent is awarded a point.
     * If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth
     * Golem is awarded a point.
     * If both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.
     * You are given a string s consisting of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures
     * Alice will summon in each round:
     *
     * If s[i] == 'F', Alice summons a Fire Dragon.
     * If s[i] == 'W', Alice summons a Water Serpent.
     * If s[i] == 'E', Alice summons an Earth Golem.
     * Bobâ€™s sequence of moves is unknown, but it is guaranteed that Bob will never summon the same creature in two
     * consecutive rounds. Bob beats Alice if the total number of points awarded to Bob after n rounds is strictly
     * greater than the points awarded to Alice.
     *
     * Return the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice.
     *
     * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
     *
     * Input: s = "FFF"
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Input: s = "FWEFW"
     * Output: 18
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
     * s[i] is either 'F', 'W', or 'E'.
     * @param s
     * @return
